# Configure Regelrett

Features that are planned but not implemented are indicated by ~~strikethroughs~~.

Regelrett has default and custom configuration files.
You can customize your Regelrett instance by modifying the custom configuration file or by using environment variables.

>After you add custom options, [uncomment](#remove-comments-in-the-yaml-files) the relevant sections of the configuration file.
>
>Restart Regelrett for your changes to take effect.

## Configuration file location

The default settings for a Regelrett instance are stored in the `<WORKING DIRECTORY>/conf/defaults.yaml` file.
_Don't_ change this file.

Your custom configuration file is the `<WORKING DIRECTORY>/conf/custom.yaml` file.
~~You can use a custom configuration path with the `--config` option.~~

The sample.yaml file is located in the same directory as defaults.yaml file.
It contains all the settings commented out. Copy sample.yaml and name it custom.yaml.

### ~~Docker~~

~~Refer to [Configure a Regelrett Docker image]() for information about environmental variables, persistent storage, and building custom Docker images.~~


## Remove comments in the .yaml files

Yaml uses hashtags (`#`) to comment out lines in the yaml file.
To uncomment a line, remove the hashtag (`#`) from the beginning of that line.

Regelrett ignores all configuration lines that begin with a hashtag.

For example:

```yaml
#http_port = 3000
```

## ~~Override configuration with environment variables~~

~~Don't use environment variables to _add_ new configuration settings.
Instead, use environmental variables to _override_ existing options.~~

~~To override an option:~~

```bash
RR_<SECTION NAME>_<KEY>
```

~~Where _`<SECTION NAME>`_ is the text within the square brackets (`[` and `]`) in the configuration file.
All letters must be uppercase, periods (`.`) and dashes (`-`) must replaced by underscores (`_`).
For example, if you have these configuration settings:~~

```yaml
base:
  instance_name: ${HOSTNAME}

security:
  admin_user: admin

auth:
  google:
    client_secret: 0ldS3cretKey

feature_toggles:
  enable: newNavigation
```

~~You can override variables on Linux machines with:~~

```bash
export GF_DEFAULT_INSTANCE_NAME=my-instance
export GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=owner
export GF_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=newS3cretKey
export GF_PLUGIN_GRAFANA_IMAGE_RENDERER_RENDERING_IGNORE_HTTPS_ERRORS=true
export GF_FEATURE_TOGGLES_ENABLE=newNavigation
```

## ~~Variable expansion~~

~~If any of your options contains the expression `$__<PROVIDER>{<ARGUMENT>}`or `${<ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE>}`, then Regelrett evaluates them.
The evaluation runs the provider with the provided argument to get the final value of the option.~~

~~There are two providers: `env` and `file`.~~

### ~~`env` provider~~

~~The `env` provider expands environment variables.
If you set an option to `$__env{PORT}` the value of the `PORT` environment variable replaces it.
For environment variables you can also use the short-hand syntax `${PORT}`.~~

~~The following example sets the log directory to the path in the `LOGDIR` environment variable:~~

```yaml
paths:
  logs: $__env{LOGDIR}/regelrett
```

### ~~`file` provider~~

~~The `file` provider reads a file from the filesystem.
It trims whitespace from the beginning and the end of files.~~

~~The following example sets the database password to the contents of the `/etc/secrets/gf_sql_password` file:~~

```yaml
database:
  password: $__file{/etc/secrets/gf_sql_password}
```

## Configuration options

The following headings describe the sections and configuration options of the Regelrett configuration file.

### `base`

#### `environment`
Options are `production` and `development`. Default is `production`.
_Don't_ change this option unless you are working on Regelrett development.

### `server`

#### `http_port`
The port the api server binds to, defaults to `8080`.

#### `http_addr`
The host for the server to listen on.
If your machine has more than one network interface, you can use this setting to expose the Regelrett service on only one network interface and not have it available on others, such as the loopback interface.
An the default value is `0.0.0.0`, which means the Regelrett service binds to all interfaces.

In environments where network address translation (NAT) is used, ensure you use the network interface address and not a final public address; otherwise, you might see errors such as `bind: cannot assign requested address` in the logs.

#### `domain`
The domain name used to access Regelrett from a browser. Important if you use GitHub or Google OAuth  (for the callback URL to be correct).

>This setting is also important if you have a reverse proxy in front of Regelrett that exposes it through a sub-path.
>
>In that case add the sub-path to the end of this URL setting.

#### `router_logging`
Set to `true` for Regelrett to log all HTTP requests (not just errors). These are logged as Info level events to the Regelrett log.

#### `allowed_origins`
The `allowed_origins` option is a comma-separated list of additional origins that is accepted by the Regelrett server.

#### `airtable_base_url`
The base url of the airtable instance to use as a schema source. Default is `https://api.airtable.com`

#### `sources`
A list of schema source specifications, indicating the individual schemas that should be loaded.

Every schema source specification includes the following fields:
##### `id`
A unique identifier used to locate the source.

##### `type`
Either `AIRTABLE` or `YAML`

In addition airtable schema source specifications include the following fields:
##### `access_token`
##### `base_id`
##### `table_id`
##### `view_id`
##### `webhook_id`
##### `webhook_secret`

Yaml schema source specifications include the following fields:
##### `endpoint`
##### `resource_path`

### `microsoft_graph`
#### `base_url`

#### `member_of_path`
